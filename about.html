                        Diamond Bay Reserve is a beautiful cliff top reserve and
                        popular attraction, known for its dramatic cliff top
                        walk with panoramic views of the ocean and coastline. In
                        1999 Waverley Council was successful in gaining a grant
                        from the Commonwealth Government’s Federation Community
                        Projects Program for a coastal walkway project marking
                        Australia’s Centenary of Federation. With Council funds
                        and assistance from the State Government Metropolitan
                        Greenspace Program, the boardwalk at Diamond Bay was
                        officially opened in 2004 by then Premier Bob Carr. A
                        spectacular setting, Diamond Bay Reserve has a 24 hour
                        off-leash dog exercise area. Dogs are to remain on-leash
                        for the remainder of the cliff walk.
